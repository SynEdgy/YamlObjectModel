SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Creates a common object model for Yaml de/serialization.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    YamlObjectModel (YOM) is an opinionated module offering an approach for PowerShell custom classes
    to implement serialization, deserialization, saving to a file, or reloading from a file.
    Each object is serialized with a kind and its spec (inspired from k8s), with the kind defining the
    type of the object, and the spec the properties needed.

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> using module YamlObjectModel
    class MyClass : YOMSaveableBase
    {
        [string] $MyString
        MyClass()
        {
            # default ctor
        }

        MyClass([IDictionary]$RawSpec)
        {
            $this.ResolveSpec($RawSpec)
        }
    }

    $a = [MyClass]@{MyString = 'some value'}
    $a.SaveTo('./myObj.yml')
    $a.Reload() # reload the properties from the file in case they have changed from the file
    $a.MyString = 'other value'
    $a.Save() # Save the changed property to the file ./myObj.yml
    $a.ToString() # Displays the yaml representation of this object
    [YOMApiDispatcher]::DispatchSpec(($a.ToString() | ConvertFrom-Yaml -ordered))
    # returns an instance of [MyClass] with the right properties
    Get-YomObject -Path './myObj.yml' loads the object from the file.
